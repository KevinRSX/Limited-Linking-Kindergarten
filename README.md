Make sure every time you do some work, 

```
git pull
```

before you edit. Put your code in a seperate directory, do not include binary files.

Also check if there is any change at upstream during your work. If there is, also pull it down before committing.

I recommend you use [branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) and merge it with master locally
